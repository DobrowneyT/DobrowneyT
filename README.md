# Hi, I'm Tristan Dobrowney üëã

**Computer Engineering Student | Embedded Systems Enthusiast | Hardware-Software Integration**

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Manitoba specializing in **computer architecture**, **instruction set design**, and **embedded systems**. I love working at the intersection of hardware and software, building systems from the ground up.

## üîß What I Do

I work on low-level systems that bridge the gap between silicon and code:

- **Hardware Interfacing**: Designing firmware and drivers for microcontrollers, FPGAs, and custom hardware
- **Computer Architecture**: Exploring instruction set design, processor design, and hardware optimization
- **Embedded Systems**: Building real-time control systems with precise timing and resource constraints
- **Communication Protocols**: Implementing CAN, J1939, ISOBUS, SPI, and I2C for industrial applications

Currently working as a **Controls Application Engineer Intern at MacDon Industries**, where I develop systems integration solutions for agricultural equipment using industrial communication protocols.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills

**Languages**: C ‚Ä¢ C++ ‚Ä¢ Python ‚Ä¢ Verilog ‚Ä¢ Java ‚Ä¢ CUDA ‚Ä¢ Assembly

**Hardware**: FPGA ‚Ä¢ Microcontrollers ‚Ä¢ Circuit Design ‚Ä¢ KiCAD ‚Ä¢ Altium

**Systems**: ROS2 ‚Ä¢ MPI ‚Ä¢ OpenMP ‚Ä¢ Real-Time Operating Systems

**Protocols**: CAN ‚Ä¢ J1939 ‚Ä¢ ISOBUS ‚Ä¢ SPI ‚Ä¢ I2C
